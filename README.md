# rustle.nvim

## introduction

my personal fork of [https://nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/](kickstart.nvim), a starting point for creating your own neovim configuration

## installation

### install neovim

rustle.nvim targets *only* the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of neovim.
if you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have at least the latest
stable version. Most likely, you want to install neovim via a [package
manager](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-from-package).
to check your neovim version, run `nvim --version` and make sure it is not
below the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) version. if
your chosen install method only gives you an outdated version of neovim, find
alternative [installation methods below](#alternative-neovim-installation-methods).

### install external dependencies

external requirements:
- basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation),
  [fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#installation)
- [tree-sitter CLI](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/crates/cli/README.md#installation)
- clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
- a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- emoji fonts (ubuntu only, and only if you want emoji!) `sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`
- language setup:
  - if you want to write typescript, you need `npm`
  - if you want to write golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

### install rustle.nvim

> [!NOTE]
> [backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux, MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| Windows (cmd)| `%localappdata%\nvim\` |
| Windows (powershell)| `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\` |

#### clone rustle.nvim

<details><summary> Linux and Mac </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arozoid/rustle.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

</details>

<details><summary> Windows </summary>

if you're using `cmd.exe`:

```
git clone https://github.com/arozoid/rustle.nvim.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
```

if you're using `powershell.exe`

```
git clone https://github.com/arozoid/rustle.nvim.git "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\nvim"
```

</details>

### post installation

start neovim

```sh
nvim
```

that's it! lazy will install all the plugins you have. use `:Lazy` to view
the current plugin status. hit `q` to close the window.

#### read the friendly documentation

read through the `init.lua` file in your configuration folder for more
information about extending and exploring neovim. that also includes
examples of adding popularly requested plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> for more information about a particular plugin, check its repository's documentation.


### getting started

### FAQ

* what should i do if i already have a pre-existing neovim configuration?
  * you should back it up and then delete all associated files.
  * this includes your existing init.lua and the Neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
* can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart?
  * yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. for example, you can install the rustle.nvim
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-rustle` and create an alias:
    ```
    alias nvim-rstl='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-rustle" nvim'
    ```
    when you run neovim using `nvim-rstl` alias, it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-kickstart`. you can apply this approach to any neovim
    distribution that you would like to try out.
* what if i want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * see [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://lazy.folke.io/usage#-uninstalling) information

### install recipes

below you can find OS specific install instructions for neovim and dependencies.

after installing all the dependencies, continue with the [Install Kickstart](#install-kickstart) step.

#### windows installation

<details><summary>windows with microsoft C++ build tools and CMake</summary>
installation may require installing build tools and updating the run command for `telescope-fzf-native`

see `telescope-fzf-native` documentation for [more details](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim#installation)

this requires:

- install CMake and the microsoft C++ build tools on windows

```lua
{'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', build = 'cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release && cmake --install build --prefix build' }
```
</details>
<details><summary>windows with gcc/make using chocolatey</summary>
alternatively, one can install gcc and make which don't require changing the config,
the easiest way is to use choco:

1. install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
either follow the instructions on the page or use winget,
run in cmd as **admin**:
```
winget install --accept-source-agreements chocolatey.chocolatey
```

2. install all requirements using choco, exit the previous cmd and
open a new one so that choco path is set, and run in cmd as **admin**:
```
choco install -y neovim git ripgrep wget fd unzip gzip mingw make tree-sitter
```

### alternative neovim installation methods

for some systems it is not unexpected that the [package manager installation
method](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-from-package)
recommended by neovim is significantly behind. if that is the case for you,
pick one of the following methods that are known to deliver fresh neovim versions very quickly.
they have been picked for their popularity and because they make installing and updating
neovim to the latest versions easy. you can also find more detail about the
available methods being discussed
[here.](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/issues/1583).
